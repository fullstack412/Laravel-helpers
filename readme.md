## Laravel 5 Helpers for Non-Laravel Projects

This project takes the useful [Laravel helper functions](http://laravel.com/docs/5.0/helpers) and allows you to use them in Non-Laravel projects.

All dependencies have been extracted out to a single helpers file. No need to import half of Symphony and Laravel to make these work.

## Setup

In the `require` key of `composer.json` file add the following

    "rappasoft/laravel-helpers": "dev-master"
